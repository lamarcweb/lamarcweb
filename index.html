<A HREF="lamarc_download.html"><b>LAMARC</b></a> is a program which estimates
population-genetic parameters such as population size, population growth
rate, recombination rate, and migration rates. It approximates a summation
over all possible genealogies that could explain the observed sample, which
may be sequence, SNP, microsatellite, or electrophoretic data.  LAMARC and
its sister program Migrate are successor programs to the older programs
Coalesce, Fluctuate, and Recombine, which are no longer being supported. 
The programs are memory-intensive but can run effectively on workstations;
we support a variety of operating systems.

The <STRONG>LAMARC</STRONG> package is not in any immediate sense derived
from the work of Jean Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, Chevalier de
<STRONG>Lamarck</STRONG> (1744-1829).  The similarity of names is mostly
accidental. But all evolutionary biologists do owe him a debt.  Lamarck is
an unfairly maligned figure.  In addition to being one of the greatest
figures of invertebrate biology, he was one of the founders (with Buffon) of
the theory of evolution, and the first to propose a mechanism for evolution.

    This is a minor bug fix release.  The bug fixed is:
    <ul>
    <li> FIXED:  lam_conv file converter reversed source and
         destination populations when using custom migration
         matrices.  If you used a custom matrix to set asymmetrical
         migration rates in any prior version, you will need to
         re-convert your files and re-run your analysis.  All
         other results are unaffected.

         should be re-run.

         your run completed successfully you did not encounter this
         bug and re-running is not necessary.
    <li> FIXED:  lam_conv file converter wrote a multi-population

    <a href="lamarc_download.html"><b>Lamarc 2.1.8</b></a>,
    This is an <b>important bug fix</b> 
    and <b>new feature</b> release. Bugs fixed are:
    <ul>
    <li> FIXED: major bug for all runs modeling migration. 
         All runs which inferred migration should be re-run.
         In addition, a bug in the reporting of migration
         start values has been fixed.
    <li> FIXED: bug affecting runs sampling a significant number
         of trees modeling negative growth.
         Runs modeling growth should
         be re-run unless they were Bayesian runs with growth
         priors not allowing negative growth.

    <li> NEW FEATURE: Correction for data derived from a <a href="documentation/panels.html">SNP panel</a>.
    <li> UPDATED: method for checking convergence in LIKELIHOOD

         rate or held it to a non-zero value in
         versions 2.1.2 through 2.1.5 should be re-run.

<h2>General</h2>

<p>
All methods presented here use the coalescence theory of <A
HREF="kingman.html">Kingman</A> (1982a, b) and estimate population
parameters like effective population size, growth rate, migration rate. To
achieve this, the methods sample random genealogies of sequences (or
alleles) and calculate the parameters. Since this is an integration over
almost an infinitely large tree space, the methods use a Metropolis Monte
Carlo sampling technique to concentrate the sampling in regions which
contribute to the final result.</P>

<P>
LAMARC is written in C++
and is also available as executables for Windows, MacOS and
Linux.  It will compile on most workstations.  You can find more
